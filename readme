You need to have Maven installed to build the plugin (use brew install maven on OSX).

Once Maven is available, update your settings.xml according to https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Plugin+tutorial

Afterwards you can build the plugin using Maven:

    mvn install

After the first run, use -o to speed up that process:

   mvn -o install

That puts a .hpi file into the target folder. Upload that to a Jenkins instance, or copy it manually to the plugins folder.

Afterwards you should be able to add "TestSwarm integration" as a build step to any type of project.
Fill in the empty fields, and a at least one testsuite. Then start a build and check the console output for results.
